## TC-1 / TC-3: maintained TinyCC SDK and shared-artifact link profile — partial

- Observed development tools: Rust/Cargo 1.95.0 with rustfmt and Clippy; TinyCC `0.9.27-unstable-2025-01-06` on x86_64 Linux. The SDK archive and C fixtures build with TinyCC `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- Red evidence: `tcc -shared` linked the archive, but its output omitted `PT_GNU_STACK`; the confined executor's glibc loader rejected it with `cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires`.
- Implementation: maintained query C objects and the archive remain TinyCC-built. The fixture link step now names `SHARED_LINKER` explicitly and applies GNU linker's `-z noexecstack` option. The Makefile documents why the linker differs from TinyCC.
- Verification: `make -f engine/sdk/Makefile test`, `make -f engine/sdk/Makefile sandbox-query-fixture`, and the DML/SQL and restricted-metadata artifacts linked with the maintained GNU linker passed their confined acceptance tests. `readelf` confirms `GNU_STACK` is RW, with no execute permission. The direct TinyCC-linked shared artifact was rejected at `dlopen` in the sandbox; it was not loaded in a trusted process.
- Remaining: pin the Nixpkgs/package derivations and compiler/support-file hashes, define the release Linux/libc profile, check generated-interface parity, and measure clean SDK builds and per-query compile/link separately. This workstation's current Nix channel and store paths are development evidence only, not a reproducible release profile.
