# Optimizer Progress

## OP-1 dependency: bounded structured SELECT request decoder

- Contract: [optimizer specification](../../specs/planner-compiler.md). The first request payload is a versioned, single-relation SELECT with explicit projections, optional bounded predicate tree, and optional LIMIT.
- Implementation: [`optimizer_request`](../../engine/src/optimizer_request.rs) decodes identifiers, record lengths, predicate tags and values into owned Rust data. It caps requests at 64 KiB, predicates at 16 KiB, projections at 128, text literals at 4,096 bytes, predicate nodes at 256, depth at 32, and boolean fan-in at 16. Unknown versions/statements/nodes, invalid booleans/operators/identifiers, truncation, and trailing bytes fail closed.
- Boundary: the decoder performs structural validation only. It has no storage access and does not bind names or types, authorize relations, choose plans, or grant execution authority. The C parser and worker channels do not call it yet.
- Regression: four unit tests cover a compound typed request, malformed outer records/identifiers, excessive collection bounds and unsupported nodes, and predicate byte/node/depth exhaustion.
- Verification: locked workspace build and format passed; warning-denied Clippy passed; serial locked workspace tests passed (129 commit integration tests and all other active suites passed; 3 cgroup-dependent commit tests and 1 disconnected-submission process test were ignored). `git diff --check` passed.
- Remaining: define and validate type semantics against authorized metadata, return only non-disclosing bind failures, produce and validate a logical/physical plan, integrate a bounded isolated optimizer process and its supervisor-bound submission channel, and execute plans through SDK operations.

## OP-2 dependency: bind SELECT against authorized relation shape

- Implementation: [`optimizer_binding`](../../engine/src/optimizer_binding.rs) decodes the v1 request, resolves its exact qualified name through the invocation-bound `PlannerMetadataConnection`, and binds projections/predicate columns to stable relation/column IDs, ordinals, types, and nullability. It validates relation shape and expression type compatibility. Missing descriptions and relation-name mismatches both return `RelationUnavailable`.
- Boundary: the helper receives no principal, grant, raw catalog, or storage handle and creates no executor permission. Its only metadata source is the planner connection opened on the admitted transaction.
- Regression: three unit tests cover stable reference binding, non-disclosing relation absence/name mismatch, and unknown-column/type-incompatible rejection. A real-redb integration regression binds an authorized user table, checks its stable table/column IDs and declared shape, and confirms a missing relation maps to `RelationUnavailable`.
- Verification: focused binder tests, the focused planner stream/metadata integration regression, locked workspace build, formatting, warning-denied Clippy, serial workspace tests, and `git diff --check` passed (132 commit integration tests passed; 3 cgroup-dependent commit tests and 1 process test ignored).
- Remaining: bind schema IDs and epochs into the plan, define additional literal coercions/SQL NULL semantics, and produce a validated logical/physical plan. Isolated optimizer process and supervisor-bound submission channel remain open.
